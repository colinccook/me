# Colin Cook on... The Scrum Software Development Process
1. [Background](#background)

## Background

In my decade-long career as a Software Engineer, I have been involved with hundreds of incoming requirements from the business.

The last six and a half years has been part of various Scrum teams, and before that a 'mini-waterfall' team.

After many retrospectives and learning the nuiances of Scrum-led project management, I have distilled many years of self-restrospection into my thoughts and writings below.

These thoughts are public on my Github profile, and I hope to grow and adapt these guidelines with time.

## Looking for Better Outcomes

Taking inspiration from Agile Software Development processes, signs that things are going well include:

✔ The business receives skateboards; regular attempts to solve their problems  
✔ Developers feel empowered to innovate with creative solutions for well-defined business problems  
✔ Product Owners are the conduit between business needs and this pool of fantastic innovation  
✔ We recognise the diversity of developers, reward correct attitudes and continuous improvement

## Why Scrum?

Scrum is currently my favoured way of reaching the above outcomes. When effectively done, it can lead to outstanding customer service.

✔ Regular sprints builds a rapport and expectation of our stakeholders  
✔ It encourages us to be democratic; everyone learns about requirements gathering and predicting sprint outcomes

## What does good Scrum look like?

To achieve the above, we need a deeper dive on key elements of team management. I've broken these themes and topics to separate documents:

### On... User Stories

Clear and intentful User Stories empower developers to come up with creative solutions

### On... Scrum Ceremonies

Every Scrum ceremony has a specific purpose and scope, and must be appropriately chaired for team engagement

### On... Code Reviews

Code reviews are a virtual learning tool amongst developers.

### On... Performance Metrics

How do we know we are delivering real value to our stakeholders?

### On... Quality Assurance

Expectations of an independent Quality Assurance team

### On... Developing Developers

Understanding the strategetic importance of seasoned developers, and their styles

### On... The Professional Balance

Reflecting on your individual actions day-to-day
